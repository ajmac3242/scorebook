### Findings & Fixed Bugs

- **Bug 1: Multi-period Minutes Played**: Discovered that `calculatePlayerAggregates` incorrectly calculates minutes played when a player remains on the court across periods. It simply subtracts the `SUB_OUT` clock time from the `SUB_IN` clock time without accounting for period resets (e.g., 10:00 in P1 to 5:00 in P2 was calculated as 5 mins instead of 15 mins).
- **Bug 2: Lineup Efficiency Duration**: Similarly to Bug 1, `calculateLineupStats` failed to correctly track the duration of 5-man lineups when they played across period boundaries.
- **Bug 3: Free Throws in FG Stats**: Found that Free Throws (makes with 1 point) were being incorrectly counted as Field Goal Attempts (FGA) and Field Goals Made (FGM) in the statistical aggregation logic.

- **Bug 4: Overstated Live Minutes**: Found that players in ongoing games were credited with playing until 0:00 of the current period even if the clock hadn't reached it yet. Fixed by introducing `liveContext` to stint calculations.
- **Bug 5: Inaccurate TS%**: True Shooting Percentage was an approximation because Free Throw Attempts (FTA) weren't tracked. Added `fta` tracking and updated the formula to `Points / (2 * (FGA + 0.44 * FTA))`.
- **Bug 6: Multi-game Stint Leakage**: `calculatePlayerAggregates` could leak active stints across different games if the event stream wasn't perfectly isolated. Added `gameId` isolation logic to the stint tracker.

### Critical Test Gaps
- Bonus situation logic (QUARTERS vs HALVES) - still needs more granular edge case testing.
- Technical foul impact on team fouls and bonus.

### Fragile Patterns to Avoid
- Assuming `clockTime` is monotonically decreasing across the entire `StatEvent` stream without checking for `period` or `gameId` changes.
- Calculating advanced metrics like TS% without all variables (like FTA) leads to significant "stat inflation".
